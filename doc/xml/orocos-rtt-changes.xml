    This document provides a quick overview of what changed between
    the Real-Time Toolkit &oldversion; and version &version;. This
    release includes all bugfixes of the &oldversion; branch. If your
    application does not work with this release, look here for
    possible causes and solutions. Also feature additions and
    improvements are documented.

	  This release is binary incompatible with RTT
	  &oldversion;.x. You need to recompile all your applications
	  in order to upgrade to this release.

      <listitem>
	<para>
	  This release can only be compiled if you have CMake version 2.6.0
	  or higher, and 2.6.3 or higher is highly recommended for correctly detecting
	  dependencies. If your distribution (like Debian Etch) does not support
	  this look for a 'backports' version, or download and install a pre-built
	  cmake package from www.cmake.org.

      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  The DeploymentComponent's import statement no longer loads 
	  regular libraries. It only loads RTT components or plugins.
	  If you require a library to be loaded in the deployer application,
	  you should link your components against it or you can make it a 
	  plugin by implementing the Plugin API, as defined
	  in the <filename>rtt/Plugin.hpp</filename> file.

	    The win32 target (MS Windows + Visual Studio) is better supported
	    than ever. It can load plugins, components and is feature-equivalent
	    to Linux, except for real-time threads and lock-free data exchange.

	    You can check real-time performance of a part of your code by
	    using the <function>rtos_enable_rt_warning()</function> and
	    <function>rtos_disnable_rt_warning()</function> functions in your
	    components. The Xenomai target will print a warning message when
	    a not real-time function is called within such a section. The other
	    targets will ignore this flag and can be safely compiled with these
	    functions present.

	    The DeploymentComponent's component and plugin loading is identical
	    to the RTT/OCL 2.x behavior. It can load components and plugins
	    from multiple paths, using the RTT_COMPONENT_PATH environment variable
	    or XML property.
